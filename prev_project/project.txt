I am working a High Performance Computing Project, which involved using openMP, MPI and Cuda to optimize sequential programs.
At Present I have a codebase of where Sentinel-1 SAR Images are Pre-Processed using openMP and Cuda. The Pre-Processing Steps include
GrayScale, Rotate & Flip, Convert HSV, Brightness & Contrast Adjustment, Image Clipping, Wiener and Gauissian Filtering.
Suggest me some application that can be done on top the existing codebase, it should be able to parallelize using openMP and Cuda.
